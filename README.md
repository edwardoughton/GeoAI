# Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI) 

Welcome to this GGS590 Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI) class. 

The class focuses on AI as a practical and applied tool for solving geospatial problems through code-based methods. Building on foundational programming and spatial computing skills, the course emphasizes how AI-assisted workflows can improve on traditional GIS analysis, rather than replace it. Students will explore how contemporary AI-tooling can be used to write, debug, refactor, test, and document geospatial code, enabling more efficient and flexible spatial analysis and automation. Throughout the course, students will use these techniques to address complex geographic questions involving spatial data analysis. Particular attention is given to evaluating the correctness and reliability of AI-assisted solutions, including the design of testing and validation strategies for GIS codebases to ensure workflows behave as intended and produce reproducible results. The course also encourages critical reflection on the limitations associated with AI tool usage in geospatial domains. By the end of the course, students will be prepared to responsibly integrate AI into geospatial workflows and to make informed methodological choices when investigating complex spatial problems.
